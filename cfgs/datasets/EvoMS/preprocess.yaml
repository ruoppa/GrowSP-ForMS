RADIUS: 4.2 # Radius of cylinders cut from the full point cloud in meters

PROCESS_ALL: False # If True, ignore plot ids in data set config and process all suitable data found in INPUT_PATH
COMPUTE_NORMALS: True # If True, precompute point cloud normals
COMPUTE_GEOMETRIC: True # If True, precompute geometric features
GEOF_RADIUS: 0.35 # Radius used for computing the geometric features
FEATURE_NAMES: [verticality, linearity, PCA1, sphericity, planarity, anisotropy] # Geometric features to compute
